        I'm Najiba Haidari. I'm a passionate coder who chose to pursue a coding and full-stack bootcamp. Ever since my college years, I've had a deep love for coding. Prior to this career switch, I gained 10 years of valuable experience in administrative roles, and I hold a bachelor's degree in finance.
        With my strong background in administration and finance, I bring a unique perspective to my coding journey. I am currently enrolled in a bootcamp, fully dedicated to honing my skills in full-stack development.
